This is the Rust implementation for generating a new galaxy in Space Settler. It will generate a
random galaxy taking into account real proportions of stars, planets and satellites to the best of
our knowledge. It will try to do as far as possible a true habitability check in rocky bodies, but
the main objective is to create as much habitable bodies as possible so that a future game could use
this database.
